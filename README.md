# cloudtalk-ruby
A pure Ruby client for CloudTalk's HTTP API.

Note: To use this API client, you'll need to contact CloudTalk and have a tenancy provisioned for your application.
Once that's in place, update cloudtalk.yml with your tenancy's information and you're ready to go.

Note #2 - This client was written in 2011 and might not reflect any Cloudtalk API changes since then. Email or message me if you run into problems and I'll put you in touch with people that can help.
